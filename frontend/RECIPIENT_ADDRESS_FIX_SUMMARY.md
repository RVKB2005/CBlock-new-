# Recipient Address Auto-Population Fix

## Problem

When verifiers tried to sign attestations, they were required to manually enter the recipient address (the wallet address of the user who uploaded the document). This created a poor user experience and potential for errors.

## Root Cause

The SignAttestation component was not receiving the uploader's wallet address, even though this information was available in the document data stored by the document service.

## Solution

Implemented automatic recipient address population by passing the uploader's wallet address through the component chain.

## Changes Made

### 1. Upload.jsx

**File:** `frontend/src/Upload.jsx`
**Change:** Added uploader information to the onUploaded callback data

```javascript
// Before
onUploaded({
  documentId: result.documentId,
  cid: result.document.cid,
  // ... other fields
});

// After
onUploaded({
  documentId: result.documentId,
  cid: result.document.cid,
  // ... other fields
  uploaderAddress: result.document.uploadedBy, // ✅ Added
  uploaderName: result.document.uploaderName, // ✅ Added
  uploaderEmail: result.document.uploaderEmail, // ✅ Added
});
```

### 2. App.jsx

**File:** `frontend/src/App.jsx`
**Change:** Pass uploaderAddress prop to SignAttestation component

```javascript
// Before
<SignAttestation uploadedData={uploaded} onSigned={onSigned} />

// After
<SignAttestation
  uploadedData={uploaded}
  onSigned={onSigned}
  uploaderAddress={uploaded?.uploaderAddress} // ✅ Added
/>
```

### 3. MintWorkflow.jsx

**File:** `frontend/src/MintWorkflow.jsx`
**Change:** Fixed prop name and uploader info passing

```javascript
// Before
<Upload
  onUploadComplete={(data) => handleUploadComplete(data, walletAddress)}
  // ...
/>

// After
<Upload
  onUploaded={(data) => handleUploadComplete(data, data.uploaderAddress)} // ✅ Fixed
  // ...
/>
```

### 4. SignAttestation.jsx

**File:** `frontend/src/SignAttestation.jsx`
**Changes:**

- Enhanced auto-population logic
- Made recipient field read-only when uploader address is available
- Added visual indicators

```javascript
// Enhanced auto-population
useEffect(() => {
  if (uploadedData && uploadedData.cid) {
    setFormData((prev) => ({
      ...prev,
      ipfsCid: uploadedData.cid,
      recipient: uploaderAddress || uploadedData.uploaderAddress || "", // ✅ Enhanced
    }));
  }
}, [uploadedData, uploaderAddress]);

// Read-only field with visual indicators
<input
  type="text"
  name="recipient"
  value={formData.recipient || ""}
  readOnly={!!(uploaderAddress || uploadedData?.uploaderAddress)} // ✅ Read-only
  className={`input-field ${
    uploaderAddress || uploadedData?.uploaderAddress
      ? "bg-green-50 border-green-300 text-green-800 cursor-not-allowed" // ✅ Visual styling
      : ""
  }`}
/>;
```

## User Experience Improvements

### Before Fix

1. User uploads document
2. Verifier opens attestation form
3. **Verifier must manually find and enter recipient address** ❌
4. Risk of entering wrong address
5. Poor user experience

### After Fix

1. User uploads document (wallet address automatically captured)
2. Verifier opens attestation form
3. **Recipient address automatically populated and locked** ✅
4. Visual confirmation shows uploader name
5. Seamless user experience

## Visual Indicators Added

- **Green background** for auto-filled recipient field
- **Check mark icon** to indicate successful auto-population
- **Read-only styling** to prevent accidental changes
- **Helper text** showing uploader name for verification

## Data Flow

```
User Upload → Document Service → Upload Component → App.jsx → SignAttestation
     ↓              ↓                ↓              ↓           ↓
Wallet Address → uploadedBy → uploaderAddress → prop → Auto-fill recipient
```

## Testing

Created comprehensive test page: `frontend/test-recipient-address-fix.html`

- Simulates document upload with uploader info
- Tests attestation form auto-population
- Validates complete integration flow
- Confirms visual indicators work correctly

## Security Benefits

1. **Eliminates human error** - No manual address entry required
2. **Prevents wrong recipient** - Address comes directly from document data
3. **Audit trail maintained** - Uploader info preserved throughout process
4. **Visual verification** - Uploader name displayed for confirmation

## Backward Compatibility

- ✅ Existing documents without uploader info still work
- ✅ Manual entry still possible when auto-fill unavailable
- ✅ VerifierDashboard already used correct approach
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Files Modified

1. `frontend/src/Upload.jsx` - Enhanced onUploaded callback
2. `frontend/src/App.jsx` - Added uploaderAddress prop
3. `frontend/src/MintWorkflow.jsx` - Fixed prop passing
4. `frontend/src/SignAttestation.jsx` - Auto-population and UI improvements

## Files Created

1. `frontend/test-recipient-address-fix.html` - Comprehensive test page
2. `frontend/RECIPIENT_ADDRESS_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This documentation

## Result

✅ **Problem Solved:** Verifiers no longer need to manually enter recipient addresses
✅ **User Experience:** Seamless attestation process with visual confirmation
✅ **Error Prevention:** Eliminates risk of wrong recipient address
✅ **Security:** Maintains audit trail and prevents human error
