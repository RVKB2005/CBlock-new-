# Pinata IPFS Service Syntax Fix

## 🔧 Issue Identified

Vite was reporting a JavaScript syntax error in `frontend/src/services/ipfs.js` at line 701:

```
Failed to parse source for import analysis because the content contains invalid JS syntax.
```

## 🔍 Root Cause

The `uploadWithApiKey` method was missing a `return` statement before the object literal, causing a syntax error:

### Before (Broken):

```javascript
if (response.ok) {
  const result = await response.json();
  console.log("✅ Pinata API Key upload successful:", result);

    cid: result.IpfsHash,  // ❌ Missing 'return {'
    url: `${this.pinataGatewayUrl}/${result.IpfsHash}`,
    // ... rest of object
  };
}
```

### After (Fixed):

```javascript
if (response.ok) {
  const result = await response.json();
  console.log("✅ Pinata API Key upload successful:", result);

  return {
    // ✅ Added missing 'return {'
    cid: result.IpfsHash,
    url: `${this.pinataGatewayUrl}/${result.IpfsHash}`,
    // ... rest of object
  };
}
```

## ✅ Fix Applied

- **Added missing `return {` statement** in the `uploadWithApiKey` method
- **Verified syntax** using Node.js syntax checker: `node -c src/services/ipfs.js`
- **Confirmed fix** resolves the Vite parsing error

## 🧪 Verification

```bash
# Syntax check passed
node -c src/services/ipfs.js
# Exit Code: 0 (success)
```

## 🎯 Result

The Pinata IPFS service now has correct JavaScript syntax and should work properly with Vite's development server. The file upload functionality using Pinata should now function correctly without syntax errors.

## 📁 File Fixed

- `frontend/src/services/ipfs.js` - Fixed missing return statement in uploadWithApiKey method

The Pinata integration is now ready for testing and use! 🚀
