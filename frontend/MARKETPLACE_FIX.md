# 🚀 Functional Marketplace Fix Complete!

## ✅ **Issues Fixed:**

### **1. Listings Disappearing Immediately**
**Problem:** Listings were fetched using wrong field names and indexes

**Fixed:**
- Changed from `listing.active` to checking `listing.amount > 0`

- Updated field names: `listing.price` → `listing.pricePerUnit`
- Added proper debug logging to track listing fetching

### **2. Marketplace Structure Mismatch**  
**Problem:** Frontend expected different contract structure than actual deployment

**Fixed:**
- Contract structure: `seller`, `tokenId`, `amount`, `pricePerUnit`
- Updated all references to use correct field names
- Fixed buy function to use `pricePerUnit` instead of `price`
- Added proper gas limits to all transactions

### **3. Multi-Account Support**

- ✅ **Wallet address display** in marketplace header
- ✅ **Account switching detection** - automatically updates when user switches accounts in MetaMask
- ✅ **"Your Listing" indicators** - shows which listings belong to current user
- ✅ **Manual refresh button** - allows users to refresh marketplace data
