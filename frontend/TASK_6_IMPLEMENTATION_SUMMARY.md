# Task 6 Implementation Summary: Modify Mint Credits Page for Role-Based Functionality

## Task Requirements ✅ COMPLETED

### ✅ Update MintCreditsPage component to check user role and render appropriate interface

- **Implementation**: Added `useEffect` hook to check user role on component mount
- **Code**: Uses `authService.getCurrentUser()` and `getCurrentUserRole()` to determine user role
- **Result**: Component now renders different interfaces based on user role (Individual, Business, Verifier)

### ✅ Hide minting and attestation controls for Individual and Business users

- **Implementation**: Removed minting controls (Credits to Mint, Price per Credit) from form for non-verifiers
- **Code**: Replaced with read-only "Estimated Credits" field that shows "To be determined by verifier"
- **Result**: Individual and Business users cannot see or access minting functionality

### ✅ Show only document upload functionality for non-verifier users

- **Implementation**:
  - Document upload form is shown for Individual and Business users
  - Project templates grid is available for non-verifiers
  - Upload and demo generation buttons are displayed
- **Code**: Conditional rendering based on `userRole !== ROLES.VERIFIER`
- **Result**: Non-verifiers see only document submission interface

### ✅ Add role-based redirects to send verifiers to their dashboard

- **Implementation**:
  - Automatic redirect after 2 seconds for verifiers
  - Toast notification explaining the redirect
  - Navigation to 'verifierDashboard' page
- **Code**: `setTimeout(() => { onNavigate('verifierDashboard'); }, 2000);`
- **Result**: Verifiers are automatically redirected to their dashboard

### ✅ Implement user-friendly messaging explaining role-specific limitations

- **Implementation**: Multiple user-friendly messages added:
  - Role-specific information banner for non-verifiers
  - Verifier redirect message with explanation
  - Updated header text and descriptions
  - Form submission guidance for different roles
- **Code**: Conditional messaging based on user role throughout the component
- **Result**: Clear communication about what each role can and cannot do

## Key Implementation Details

### Role Detection and State Management

```javascript
const [currentUser, setCurrentUser] = useState(null);
const [userRole, setUserRole] = useState(null);

useEffect(() => {
  const user = authService.getCurrentUser();
  const role = getCurrentUserRole(user);
  setCurrentUser(user);
  setUserRole(role);

  // Redirect verifiers
  if (isVerifier(user)) {
    // ... redirect logic
  }
}, [onNavigate]);
```

### Conditional UI Rendering

- **Headers**: Different titles and descriptions for each role
- **Action Buttons**: Upload buttons only for non-verifiers
- **Form Fields**: Estimated credits (read-only) instead of minting controls
- **Stats Display**: "Documents Submitted" vs "Credits Minted"
- **Project Cards**: Different status information based on role

### Form Submission Logic

```javascript
// For non-verifiers, create document submission record
if (userRole !== ROLES.VERIFIER) {
  const documentSubmission = {
    ...formData,
    status: "pending_verification",
    submittedBy: currentUser?.email || "Unknown",
    submitterRole: userRole,
  };
  // ... submission logic
}
```

### User Experience Enhancements

- **Information Banners**: Explain what each role can do
- **Toast Notifications**: Provide feedback on actions and redirects
- **Visual Indicators**: Role-specific styling and messaging
- **Status Tracking**: Different project card displays for each role
