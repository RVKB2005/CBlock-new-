## Tests Implemented

### 1. Integration Tests for Document Upload and Verification Workflow

**File:** `frontend/src/test/integration/document-workflow.test.js`

**Coverage:**

- Individual user document upload flow
- Business user document upload flow with organization info
- Verifier document review and attestation workflow
- Complete end-to-end workflow from upload to credit allocation
- Role-based access control integration
- Error handling for upload failures, attestation errors, and network issues

**Key Test Scenarios:**

- Document upload with IPFS storage and blockchain registration
- Role-specific UI rendering and functionality
- Attestation workflow with EIP-712 signature generation
- Credit minting and automatic allocation to original uploaders
- Cross-role interaction validation

### 2. End-to-End User Journey Tests

**File:** `frontend/src/test/e2e/user-journeys.test.js`

**Coverage:**

- Complete individual user journey (upload → verification → credit receipt)
- Complete business user journey with organization-specific features
- Complete verifier journey (review → attest → mint)
- Cross-role interactions and security boundaries
- Error handling and recovery scenarios
- Authentication state management during sessions

**Key Test Scenarios:**

- Full user workflows from login to task completion
- Role transitions and permission changes
- Concurrent operations and race conditions
- Network error recovery and retry mechanisms
- Session persistence and restoration

### 3. Performance Tests for Document Operations

**File:** `frontend/src/test/performance/document-operations.test.js`

**Coverage:**

- Document list loading performance with various dataset sizes
- IPFS upload performance for different file sizes
- Memory usage and cleanup verification
- Rendering performance optimization
- Network performance under slow conditions

**Key Performance Metrics:**

- Small document lists (10 items): < 100ms load time
- Medium document lists (100 items): < 500ms load time
- Large document lists (1000+ items): < 1000ms with pagination
- Small file uploads (1MB): < 2 seconds
- Medium file uploads (5MB): < 10 seconds with progress tracking
- Large file uploads (10MB): < 30 seconds with chunking

### 4. Enhanced Smart Contract Tests

**File:** `hardhat/test/DocumentRegistry.comprehensive.test.js`

**Coverage:**

- Role-based access control for contract functions
- Document lifecycle management (registration → attestation → minting)
- Bulk operations and scalability testing
- Data integrity and validation
- Query optimization and filtering
- Gas usage optimization
- Security and access control validation

**Key Test Scenarios:**

- Verifier-only attestation enforcement
- Document integrity throughout lifecycle
- Concurrent document operations
- Large-scale document handling (100+ documents)
- Edge cases and error conditions

### 5. Comprehensive Role-Based Functionality Tests

**File:** `frontend/src/test/comprehensive/role-based-tests.test.jsx`

**Coverage:**

- Authentication service role management
- RoleGuard component integration
- Permission-based access control
- Role-based user scenarios
- Security and edge case handling

**Key Test Areas:**

- **Authentication Service:** getUserRole, isVerifier, hasPermission, isUserAuthenticated
- **RoleGuard Component:** Authentication requirements, role-based access, permission checks
- **User Scenarios:** Individual, business, and verifier workflows
- **Security:** Corrupted data handling, missing permissions, null/undefined states
